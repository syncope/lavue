General Settings
================

The first tab of the configuration dialog contains **General Settings**. It is divided into a few groups:

.. figure:: ../../_images/lavuegeneralconfig.png


**Image source**

*    **Refresh time in s:** select a minimal time between consecutive frames
*    **Auto enlarge refresh time** automatically changes the refresh time if it is too small
*    **Number of image sources:**  a number of different image sources  from which images should be stitched
*    **Map images to color channels:** places images form different image sources to separate color channels
*    **Interrupt on source errors:** stops live image viewing on image source errors
*    **Display specific for a source:** store/retrieve display parameters for an each image source separately
*    **Source timeout in ms:** maximal time in milliseconds to wait for a response , e.g. from  Hidra or HTTP image sources

**Statistics and 1d plots**

*    **Intensity scaling:** applies the intensity display scaling to image statistics and 1d-plots
*    **Calculate variance:** perform calculations of variance from image pixel intensities

**ZMQ security stream**

*    **Enabled:** turns on sending the ZMQ security stream with basic information about the image, e.g. maximal intensity
*    **Automatic port:** selects a port number for the ZMQ security stream automatically
*    **Port:** defines a port number for the ZMQ security stream

**Image display**

*    **Maximal memory buffer size:** maximal frame number in the memory buffer
*    **Mask pixels with NAN:** stores masked pixels as a float Not-A-Number (NAN)
*    **Max value added to negative mask:** add maximal type value of current image to the negative high value mask
*    **Pixel masks with zero values:** causes that zero pixel values of mask image are interpreted as masking
*    **Intensity overflow color:** causes that pixels with intesity over the overflow value are ploted in the color
*    **Keep original coordinates:** causes the 2D-plot axes transforms with image transformation
*    **Lazy image slider:** plot a new image after the image slider is focused out
*    **Aspect Ratio locked:** sets the aspect ratio to 1:1 in the 2D-plot
*    **Auto Down-Sample:** turns on auto-down-sampling mode of pyqtgraph
*    **Float type for intensity:**  type to which intensity is converted if it is changed to float type
*    **Accelerate memory buffer sum:** speeds up calculation of an image sum for the memory buffer tool
*    **Image channels with gradient colors:** use gradient color maps to display pixel intensities in the RGB-channel  mode
*    **Ranges and ROIs Colors:** allows to defined colors of Ranges or ROIs selection frames. Colors are used cyclically

**ROIs**

*    **Show all ROIs values:** calculates ROIs sum values for all ROI frames
*    **Send ROIs values:** sends ROIs sum values to `LaVueController` tango server
*    **Single ROIs aliases:** adds `rois1`, `roi2`, `roi3`, ... aliases if a number of rois is higher than their aliases

**Tools**

*    **Store detector geometry for Angle/Q:** store the detector geometry for the Angle/Q tool in the configuration settings
*    **Geometry form a source:** fetch metadata parameters describing detector geometry from the image source
*    **Display extension refresh time in s:** Minimum refresh time for display extensions
*    **Parameter polling interval in s:** time in seconds between read-outs of detector tango attributes in the Parameters tool
*    **Crosshair locker switched on:**  initial status of intensity crosshair locker
*    **Diffractogram size:** number of points in the diffractogram
*    **Correct Solid Angle:** correct solid angle flag for diffractogram
*    **Send results to LavueController:** sends the current tool results to `LaVueController` tango server

**Sardana**

*    **Enabled:** turns on communication with Sardana
*    **Door:** Door tango device to communicate with Sardana
*    **Add ROIs to MG:** causes the ROIs Apply button adds the corresponding ROIs aliases into the current Sardana Measurement Group
*    **Fetch ROIs order:** read a ROIs order from Sardana environment variables
